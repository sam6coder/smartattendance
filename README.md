SMART ATTENDANCE APP USING AMAZON REKOGNITION

The Smart Attendance App is built with Flutter and  Amazon Rekognition  to revolutionize attendance management by combining the ease of mobile technology with the precision of facial recognition. By using Amazon Rekognition, the app ensures that attendance is marked only when the authorized individual is physically present, thereby eliminating the possibility of proxy attendance. The App records attendance by scanning the face of each student and comparing it with already registered student in Amazon S3. It also provides functionalities like -:

- Student and Teacher Pannel with authentication.
- Predictive analysis
- Accessing student attendance records from teacher's pannels.
- Student Resources ( Helpline numbers and google maps to some important locations) .
- Fetching Attendance Report for individual student (from student pannel)
